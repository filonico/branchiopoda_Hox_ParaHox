# README
- <code>intron_beds/</code> contains bed files of HPHG introns. 
- <code>.tsv</code> files are necessary to generate the multi-panel **Fig. 2**; intron data were obtained from bed files in <code>intron_beds</code>.
- <code>HPHG_statistics.R</code> is the R script to generate raw **Fig. 2**. The final version was then manually edited.

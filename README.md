In this repository you will find raw data and codes used for perform the analyses of *Hox* and *ParaHox* genes (HPHGs) in Branchiopoda.

Paper: REFERENCE

<code>01_HPHG_seqs</code> contains HPHG sequences from the species analysed in fasta format.
<code>02_HPHG_trees</code> contains HPHG ML phylogenetic trees as in **Fig. 1A** and **Fig. 3**.

<code>scripts/</code> contains three scripts that I wrote to manage HOXL analyses during my internship.

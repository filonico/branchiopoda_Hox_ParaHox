In this repository you will find raw data and codes used for perform the analyses of *Hox* and *ParaHox* genes (HPHGs) in Branchiopoda.

## Infos
- <code>01_HPHG_seqs</code> contains HPHG sequences in fasta format and also data and R script to generate **Suppl. Fig. S2**.
- <code>02_HPHG_trees</code> contains HPHG ML phylogenetic trees as in **Fig. 1A** and **Fig. 3**.
- <code>03_HPHG_structure</code> contains data and R script to generate the raw version of **Fig. 1B**.
- <code>04_HPHG_statistics</code> contains data and R script to generate the raw version of **Fig. 2**.
- <code>scripts/</code> contains additional bash scripts that I wrote to manage HPHG analyses during my internship.
